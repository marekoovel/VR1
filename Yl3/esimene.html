<h2><a name="history">History</a></h2>
<p><b>ABB</b> resulted from the 1988 merger of the <em>Swedish</em> corporation Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA) and the <em>Swiss</em> company Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC); the latter had absorbed the Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon in 1967. CEO at the time of the merger was the former CEO of ASEA, Percy Barnevik, who ran the company until 1996.

ABB's history goes back to the late 19th century. The company was incorporated by Ludwig Fredholm in 1883 and Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) was formed in 1891 in Baden, Switzerland, by Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown and Walter Boveri as a Swiss group of electrical companies producing AC and DC motors, generators, steam turbines and transformers.</p>
<h2><a name="organization">Organizational structure</a></h2>
ABB is the world's largest builder of electricity grids[5] and is active in many sectors, its core businesses being in power and automation technologies. The company has one corporate division and four production divisions since reorganisation in January 2016. ABB is one of the few large companies that have successfully implemented the matrix structure in their organization.
<h3>Electrification Products</h3>
The Electrification Products division manufactures low- and medium-voltage low-voltage circuit breakers, switches, control products, wiring accessories, enclosures and cable systems to protect people, installations and electronic equipment from electrical overload. The division further makes KNX systems that integrate and automate a building's electrical installations, ventilation systems, and security and data communication networks. Electrification Products also incorporates an Electrification Solutions unit manufacturing low voltage switchgear and motor control centres. Customers include a wide range of industry and utility operations, plus commercial and residential buildings.
<h4>Discrete Automation and Motion</h4>
<p>The Discrete Automation and Motion division provides products and services for industrial production. It includes electric motors, generators, drives, power electronics and industrial robots. ABB has installed over 200,000 robots.[6] In 2006, ABB opened a manufacturing centre in Shanghai, China. Also, wind generators, solar power inverters and UPS products belong to this division.</p>
<h5>Process Automation</h5>
<p>The main focus of this ABB business is to provide customers with systems for control, plant optimization, and industry-specific automation applications. The industries served include oil and gas, power, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper, metals and minerals, marine and turbocharging. The division consists of seven business units: Control Technologies (the world's No 1 DCS supplier), Marine & Ports, Measurement & Analytics, Oil, Gas & Chemicals, Power Generation, Process Industries and Turbocharging.</p>
<h6>Power Grids</h6>
<p>The Power Grids division offers key components for the transmission and distribution of electricity. The division incorporates ABB's manufacturing network for transformers, switchgear, circuit breakers, cables, and associated high voltage equipment such as digital protective relays. It also offers maintenance services. The division also offers turnkey systems and service for power transmission and distribution grids, and for power plants. Electrical substations and substation automation systems are key areas. Additional highlights include flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS), high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems and network management systems. The division is subdivided into five business units - High Voltage Products, Transformers, Grid Systems, Grid Automation and Grid Integration.</p>
<h2><a name="corporation">Corporate affairs</a></h2>
<u>In 1990, ABB purchased Westinghouse's metering and control division (the load control division was spun off to Cannon Technologies in the late 1990s and the meter division was spun off to Elster Electricity in the early 2000s). Also, in the early 1990s, ABB purchased Combustion Engineering (C-E), headquartered in Stamford and Norwalk, Connecticut, a leading U.S. firm in the development of conventional fossil fuel power and nuclear power supply systems to break into the North American market. Klaus Agthe was CEO of the US operation at the time. Continuing with its expansion plans, ABB purchased Elsag Bailey, a process automation group, in 1997 which included Bailey Controls, Hartmann & Braun, and Fischer & Porter. This was the largest acquisition to date in ABB's history.</u>
